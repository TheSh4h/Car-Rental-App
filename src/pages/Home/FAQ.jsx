      question: "3. How do I find such low rental car prices?",
      answer: "Book in advance: Booking your rental car ahead of time can often result in lower prices. Compare prices from multiple companies: Use websites like Kayak, Expedia, or Travelocity to compare prices from multiple rental car companies.
